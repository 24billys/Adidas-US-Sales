# Adidas Sales Dataset Analysis
Welcome to my Adidas Sales Dataset Analysis project! In this project, I have delved into a comprehensive dataset of Adidas sales, downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset encompasses various aspects of the sales, including revenue, product details, customer information, geographical data, and profitability.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, geographical trends, seasonal patterns, and profitability of Adidas products. By utilizing SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for data visualization, I have explored the dataset to answer a series of key questions.

## Dataset
This Dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset), an Adidas sales dataset is a collection of data that includes information on the sales of Adidas products. This type of dataset may include details such as the number of units sold, the total sales revenue, the location of the sales, the type of product sold, and any other relevant information.

## Key Questions Explored
During the analysis, I sought answers to the following questions:

### Sales Analysis
 - What is the total revenue generated over the years? (SQL)
 - How does revenue vary by retailer over time? (Tableau)
 - What are the top 10 products over the years? (SQL)
 - What is the average daily sales value by retailer? (SQL)
 - What is the peak sales period? (Tableau)

### Customer Analysis
 - What are the top regions, states, and cities for sales? (SQL)

 - How do seasonal trends affect various product categories? (Tableau)

### Profitability Analysis
 - What is the profit margin for different products or categories? (SQL)
 - How does profitability vary across different sales methods? (SQL)

## Tools Used
To perform this analysis, I utilized SQL for data manipulation and exploration, and Tableau for data visualization. These tools allowed me to efficiently analyze the dataset, discover meaningful insights, and present them visually for better understanding.

Feel free to explore the analysis and the answers to the key questions I have addressed. I hope this project provides valuable insights into the sales performance and various aspects of Adidas products.
